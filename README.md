dotvim
======

My .vim folder, with vim plugins installed as submodules.

Notes
-----
* taglist is not a submodule, because the one at
  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273 is way ahead of the git
  mirror at https://github.com/vim-scripts/taglist.vim.
* vim-powerline is going to be replaced by powerline. So this needs to be
  changed in the near future. Further, patched fonts need to be installed to
  fully make use of vim-powerline.
